## The plan

 You make money in daily fantasy sports by beating other players by more than you pay to the providers. We'll aim to find contests with the smallest provider fees (highest expected value) and the worst players (easiest field). If we do that; we've got a chance at not losing our money. Along the way we'll blog our adventures in learning about how the daily fantasy sports providers operate; how bad the rake is; and how good (or bad) the typical players are. It's a clear bonus I'm a hockey fan - so it should make it a bit less of a slog to bid day in and out. Key caveat I don't expect to be anything but average at creating fantasy lineups to compete.

  What are daily fantasy sports?
</p>

A daily game in which you gamble on individual player performance on a particular date. Admittedly fantasy sports has always resolved around gambling; but essentially no one participates in daily fantasy without paying into a provider who is taking a stake of the prize pool in every game.  Who are those providers? Mostly Draft Kin
