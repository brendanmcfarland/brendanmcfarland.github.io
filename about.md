## Press

### Kotaku - dollarstodust.com

Kotaku wrote an [article referencing](https://kotaku.com/hours-to-earn-an-average-professional-deck-in-hearthson-1635943268/all) a _hacky_ website I made on google app engine with python and django in 2014. My website is now dead - but it functioned well enough for the writer to calculate the cost of a hobby playing Blizzard's [Hearthstone](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/). The experience also made me realize how accessible coding was and kept my coding hobbing growing.

Have questions or suggestions?
