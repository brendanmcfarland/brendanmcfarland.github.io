I've been a lifelong hockey fan, played fantasy sports for 20+ years, and have been curious about the realm of daily fantasy sports providers ever since the industry received press when their employees were fixing bets [against their own customers](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/sports/fanduel-draftkings-fantasy-employees-bet-rivals.html). I'm excited for my first experiment this year.

I'm taking a few months to dive into NHL daily fantasy hockey. The idea is to play with a small amount of money and apply maths to the contests, players, and nhl to attempt to find out something interesting about the market. I picked hockey because my theory is it's a small pond that's either much easier, or much harder, than the cash cow fantasy sports. I'll log the contests entered, players faced, results, trends in contests draftkings makes available; and just generally ask questions and look for interesting wrinkles.


I'm keeping a summary of the project in the [sidebar](http://strive.space/nhldfs/) and have a plan to blog weekly on progress.
